#####Requirements:
Ruby, terminal, PostgreSQL, gems: activerecord, rake, active_record_migrations, bundle, shoulda-matcher

#####Instructions:
Download zip file.  Open terminal, and change directory to location of the file.  In terminal, type "$ ruby evo_tournament_ui.rb." Have fun!

#####Known Bugs/Functionalities not yet created:
- Admin cannot yet delete divisions or games.
- Admin cannot yet update items.
- There is a bug when trying to assign a game to a competitor.  The method will work as far as allowing the admin to select a division, then selecting the competitor from the chosen division, however an error message will pop up when selecting the game to assign to the competitor. Still have yet to work out.
